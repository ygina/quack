# QuACK

This repository contains code for the HotNets '22 paper,
"Sidecar: In-Network Performance Enhancements in the Age of
Paranoid Transport Protocols".
The _quACK (quick ACK)_ is a concise representation of a
multiset of numbers that can be used to efficiently decode
the randomly-encrypted packet contents a sidecar has received.
